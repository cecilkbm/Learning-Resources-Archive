# 📚 Free Learning Resources Archive (Programming • Security • Cloud • Pentesting)

Over the past three years, I’ve collected free educational resources (primarily PDFs) shared across LinkedIn and other public platforms.

This repository serves as a centralized archive of those materials, covering a wide range of topics from software engineering and cloud computing to cybersecurity and penetration testing fundamentals.

The goal is simple:

Preserve freely shared knowledge and make it easier for others to learn.
